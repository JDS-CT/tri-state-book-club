# Awards Reveal Assets

This directory collects the final presentation materials for the annual awards reveal. Keep HTML snapshots, the JSON data feed used by the live site, any audio stingers, and exported slide decks here so they stay versioned alongside the rest of the season artifacts.

- Place the structured awards data in `awards.json`.
- Save any one-off HTML exports (for archival playback) next to this README.
- Store supporting sound cues in `audio/` and slide files in `slides/`.
- Drop presenter notes, scripts, or cue sheets in `notes/`.

Add new assets as they become available so the ceremony can be reconstructed without hunting through chat logs or cloud drives.
