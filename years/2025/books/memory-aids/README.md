# 2025 Memory Aids

Each file in this directory captures a single bookâ€™s synopsis and key characters using the shared memory-aid template. Frontmatter fields identify the title, author, club year, and flag the note as a memory aid so other tools can parse them consistently.

See [`../../../../docs/data-schema.md`](../../../../docs/data-schema.md) for the canonical template and additional guidance.
