## Synopsis
On a harsh colony planet, Mickey Barnes—a so-called “expendable”—is killed and reprinted repeatedly to take the lethal risks others won’t. When a second Mickey appears, identity, loyalty, and purpose twist in unexpected ways. The mission’s stakes push everyone to question what it means to truly live.
