## Synopsis
The Society maintains mystical objects too dangerous for ordinary hands, but when artifacts vanish, chaos follows. Magda Sparks and Frank Simpson team up to retrieve them even as old alliances crack. The line between trustworthy and corrupt blurs when objects remember more than people do.

## Key Characters
- **Magda Sparks** — retrieval specialist for the Society; tough, grief-hardened, focused.
- **Frank Simpson** — investigator who pairs with Magda when objects go missing.
- **Cassie Andrews** — survivor of the Doors affair, tied in by the books’ fallout.
- **Lund** — stoic protector whose loyalties are to people over institutions.
- **The Archivist** — the Society’s opaque keeper of rules and secrets.
