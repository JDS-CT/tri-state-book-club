## Synopsis
Firefighter Owen and spy Maya awaken inside a crumbling survival facility with no memory of how humanity fell. Their search for answers reveals a manufactured “extinction trial” run by inscrutable machines, resurrected bodies, and a virus designed to edit memories. The final reveal—that they are on a terraformed Venus being groomed as corporate conquerors—forces them to decide whether to perpetuate or break the cycle of exploitation.

- **Owen** — Reluctant hero determined to keep the survivors alive while decoding the trial’s rules.
- **Maya** — Spy infected with a memory virus whose loyalty wavers until she sees the larger conspiracy.

- **Dr. Sato** — Scientist whose sacrifice exposes the truth behind the “extinction bus” attack and the corporate agenda.
