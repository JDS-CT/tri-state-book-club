## Synopsis
Dorothy Gale’s journey through Oz takes a darker turn when she and her loyal dog Toto uncover a conspiracy in the Emerald City. Bound by magic and betrayal, alliances shift as they seek to restore order. But the deeper they dig, the more they realize that Oz’s greatest threats come from within.

## Key Characters
- **Toto** — sardonic, fiercely loyal dog narrating the adventure and watching everyone’s blind spots.
- **Dorothy Gale** — Kansas teen swept into Oz whose choices keep pulling the crew into bigger trouble.
- **Crow** — a blue jay who insists he’s a crow; revolutionary instincts and a knack for stirring crowds.
- **Min (the Rook)** — gargoyle-like ally who provides muscle and blunt practicality when plans go sideways.
- **The Wizard** — smoke-and-mirrors autocrat whose “solutions” are mostly grifts with good PR.
