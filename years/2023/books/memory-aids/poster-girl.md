## Synopsis
In a post-regime Seattle divided between the reeducated and the privileged, former propaganda darling Sonya Kantor is released from prison to find a missing child. The hunt forces her to retrace the sins of her family, confront the surveillance state they helped build, and weigh freedom against the guilt she carries for those betrayed in her name.

## Key Characters
- **Sonya Kantor** — Once the Delegation’s smiling face, she now navigates the rubble of her past while searching for the stolen child.
- **Alexander Price** — Former true believer who exposed the Kantors; his uneasy alliance with Sonya tests loyalty and remorse.
- **Nova** — Underground hacker whose skills and mistrust of authority keep Sonya alive and moving toward the truth.
- **Grace Park** — The abducted girl whose fate exposes the Delegation’s child-harvesting conspiracy.
