## Synopsis
Maggie Drakeford inherits a centuries-old curse tied to a demon named Laszlo, and to break it she must navigate demon politics, family betrayal, and the cost of magic. Laszlo, jaded and lapsed in duty, becomes both obstacle and unlikely ally. Dark secrets in Hell’s ledger expand outward to threaten both mortal and infernal realms.

## Key Characters
- **Laszlo** — 800-year-old demon and Hell’s laziest curse-keeper.
- **Maggie Drakeford** — sharp Drakeford descendant whose family is bound to the curse.
- **The Overseer** — high-ranking demon auditing curse-keepers with lethal efficiency.
- **Laszlo’s Father** — powerful demon patriarch who “motivates” with punishment.
- **A Drakeford Elder** — family member warped by the Witchstone’s centuries-old curse.
