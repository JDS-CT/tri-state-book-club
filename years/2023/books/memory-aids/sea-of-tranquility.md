## Synopsis
Centuries-spanning timelines converge around a strange anomaly first glimpsed in a Canadian forest and later inside a lunar colony. As time traveler Gaspery-Jacques Roberts investigates, he discovers that the anomaly is a closed loop created by his own intervention, forcing him to decide which version of history—and whose lives—are worth preserving.

## Key Characters
- **Gaspery-Jacques Roberts** — Time Institute detective whose actions both cause and resolve the time-stream anomaly.
- **Edwin St. Andrew** — Exiled aristocrat who first witnesses the rift in the woods of 1912 Vancouver Island.
- **Olive Llewellyn** — Author touring a plague-haunted Earth in 2203 whose life is entwined with the anomaly.
- **Zoey** — Gaspery’s sister inside the Time Institute, navigating the ethics of manipulating history.
