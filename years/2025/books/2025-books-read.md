## Forms

last years form
[2024 book club vote form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdu6lpMhkdxYnq9UQvKJvcfSf7D_Tj4Ix-ivHWHpzTxVAlnZg/viewform?usp=dialog) This was just for voting, we also want to collect feedback with a form.

Everyone submitted written responses to each question, you will notice that the awards webpage makes use of this and displays all written responses before picking the winner. The users submitt their answers ranked choice style so that each choice ends up with higher votes. It can also be that people are mentioning the same thing with two different wordings because its manual input. Now for something like best book we want to let them do their voting with dropdown menu, its discrete there is not ambiguity between what is available. But for something like best plot twist or best character the users will need to do custom responses and I will need to manually review to make sure we do not have duplicates. But for the index.html having all the non-voted for options flying around is amusing so we keep the format. Can you generate a form or the file which can be imported to create a google form based on the following categories.

- "Best Book"
- "Best Character"
- "Worst Book"
- "Worst Character"
- "Best Plot Twist"
- "Memorable Use of Imagery"
- "Attractive Character"
- "Supporting Character"
- "Original Concept"
- "Most Anticipated Before Reading"
- "Most Memorable Book Club Moment"
- "Best Book (All book club years)"
- "Book to re-read (All book club years)"
