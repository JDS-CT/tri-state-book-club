## Synopsis
In Nexus, heir-apparent scions from four houses—shadow, necromancy, elemental, and divine—struggle to keep the gods tethered to their realm. Taesia Lastrider’s ambition to reopen the sealed heavens collides with political assassinations, revenant conjurations, and forbidden magic. As the city fractures, the heirs must choose between family loyalty and preventing an apocalypse.
