# TODO

TEST -- using AGENTS.md file
âœ… [p1] Investigate why the ceremony page stalls on "Loadingâ€¦" when opened locally and trace the awards data request path.
âœ… [p1] Update `Awards Webpage/js/awardsLoader.js` so file:// origins skip the hanging `fetch` attempt and rely on the resilient XHR fallback.
âœ… [p1] Add a regression test in `tests/awards-loader.test.js` proving the file:// bypass loads 2024 data without invoking `fetch`.
âœ… [p1] Restore awards data loading so selecting 2024 (and earlier years) renders ceremony content from `years/<year>/awards.json`.
âœ… [p1] Add regression tests in `tests/awards-loader.test.js` covering successful data fetch and rendering for the default year.
âœ… [p2] Implement animated background that drifts award-related words from the selected year and earlier using the existing layout.
âœ… [p2] Ensure background word animation logic is testable with unit coverage for filtering eligible terms.
âœ… [p2] Document annual awards workflow referencing `years/<year>/` archives.
âœ… [p1] Restore awards loader support when running the site over file:// by adding a resilient fallback in `js/awardsLoader.js`.
âœ… [p1] Add regression tests in `tests/awards-loader.test.js` covering the new offline-safe loading path.
ðŸ”² [p3] Plan website updates so the awards site can surface multiple years with navigation and data-driven pages.
ðŸ”² [p4] Research and document tooling to assist with ranked-choice vote aggregation ahead of winner selection.
