## Synopsis
Mysterious boxes appear worldwide, each containing a string that reveals the holder’s remaining lifespan. Eight strangers grapple with what to do with the knowledge—whether to open the box, disclose their length, or build policy around it. Their intertwined choices spark social unrest, political movements, and intimate reckonings about how to live when time is quantified.

## Key Characters

- **Ben** — Architect whose secret long string complicates his romance with Amie.
- **Nina** — Social worker advocating for short-string dignity and building a family from loss.
- **Hank** — Doctor with a short string who wrestles with mortality while guiding patients.
- **Anthony Rollins** — Politician leveraging fear of short-string holders to seize power.
